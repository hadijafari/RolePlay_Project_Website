3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Click "Connect" and start talking!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

The API key should already be in your `.env` file at:
```
D:\workspaces\AI-Tutorials\AI Agents\MyAgentsTutorial\agents\.env
```

Make sure it contains:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

If you don't have an API key yet:
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to the `.env` file

**Note:** The Realtime API is in beta. Make sure your account has access to it.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd "D:\workspaces\AI-Tutorials\AI Agents\MyAgentsTutorial\agents\2_openai\Interview RolePlay Website"
npm install
```

This will install the required Node.js packages (Express, dotenv, cors).

### 3. Start the Server

Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ Server is running on http://localhost:3000
üìÅ Serving files from: [your directory]
üîë API Key loaded: ‚úÖ Yes
```

If you see "‚ùå No" for the API key, check your `.env` file location and contents.

### 4. Open in Browser

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

1. Click the **"‚öôÔ∏è Settings"** button (optional)
2. Choose your preferred voice:
   - **Alloy** - Neutral and balanced
   - **Echo** - Warm and friendly
   - **Shimmer** - Bright and enthusiastic
3. Customize the system instructions to change the agent's behavior
4. Settings are automatically saved in your browser

**Note:** The API key is automatically loaded from your `.env` file, so you don't need to enter it manually!

### 6. Start Talking!

1. Click the **"Connect"** button
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Wait for the status to show "Connected - Listening"
4. Start speaking naturally - the AI will respond!

## Usage Tips

- **Clear Chat**: Click "Clear Chat" to remove conversation history from the screen.
- **Disconnect**: Click "Disconnect" when you're done to stop the session.

## Troubleshooting

### "Please enter your OpenAI API key"
- Make sure you've entered a valid API key in the Settings panel
- The key should start with `sk-`

### "Connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is correct and has access to the Realtime API
- Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages

### No audio/microphone issues
- Ensure your browser has microphone permissions
- Check if your microphone is working in other applications
- Try using HTTPS or localhost (some browsers require secure context for microphone access)

### Agent not responding
- Make sure the status shows "Connected - Listening"
- Try speaking louder or closer to the microphone
- Check if the audio visualization shows your voice

### Audio quality issues
- Check your microphone quality
- Reduce background noise
- Try a different voice in Settings
